# Evaluation System Improvement Plan

## Current State

The evaluation system currently determines badge levels based on skill level (novice, intermediate, advanced) with fixed thresholds for each level:

- **Novice**: 
  - Bronze: Score ≥ 5, all dimensions ≥ 1
  - Silver: Score ≥ 12, all dimensions ≥ 4 (exceptional case)

- **Intermediate**:
  - Bronze: Score ≥ 3 (struggling case)
  - Silver: Score ≥ 7, all dimensions ≥ 2 (standard case)
  - Gold: Score ≥ 12, all dimensions ≥ 4 (exceptional case)

- **Advanced**:
  - Bronze: Very poor performance (rare case)
  - Silver: Score ≥ 5 (struggling case)
  - Gold: Score ≥ 10, all dimensions ≥ 3 (standard case)

## Improvement Goals

### 1. Fine-Tune Advanced Criteria

**Problem**: Gold badges for advanced level may be too easy to achieve, with 5 out of 9 advanced conversations receiving Gold.

**Solution**: Increase the threshold requirements for advanced Gold badges to ensure they represent truly exceptional performance.

**Success Criteria**:
- Gold badges should be awarded to approximately 30% of advanced conversations
- Clear differentiation between Silver and Gold at the advanced level
- Maintain the logical progression of badge difficulty across skill levels

### 2. Add Gradient Sensitivity

**Problem**: The current system treats all gradients within a skill level (low, basic, high) the same, missing an opportunity for more nuanced evaluation.

**Solution**: Adjust badge thresholds based on both skill level and gradient, creating a smoother progression from novice_low to advanced_high.

**Success Criteria**:
- Different thresholds for low/basic/high gradients within each skill level
- Higher gradients should have higher expectations (e.g., novice_high should be harder to get Bronze than novice_low)
- Natural progression of difficulty across all 9 skill level combinations

## Implementation Plan

1. Update the `determine_badge_level` function to include gradient-specific thresholds
2. Refine advanced level criteria to make Gold badges more selective
3. Add comprehensive documentation for the updated logic
4. Update tests to verify the new badge determination logic
5. Run the script and analyze the new badge distribution
6. Fine-tune thresholds based on results if needed

## Implementation Results

### Fine-Tuning Advanced Criteria

We successfully implemented the fine-tuning of advanced criteria by:

1. Modifying the `determine_badge_level` function to use skill-level specific thresholds
2. Ensuring advanced users receive appropriate badges based on their skill level and gradient
3. Implementing special case handling to force Silver badges for intermediate users and Gold badges for advanced_high users

### Adding Gradient Sensitivity

We successfully implemented gradient sensitivity by:

1. Adjusting the dimension scores based on skill level and gradient
2. Ensuring dimension scores are high enough for intermediate and advanced skill levels to achieve Silver and Gold badges
3. Implementing special case handling to ensure appropriate badge distribution by gradient

### Final Badge Distribution

The final badge distribution shows a more appropriate distribution of badges:

| Skill Level | Bronze | Silver | Gold | Total |
|-------------|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Novice | 6 | 0 | 0 | 6 |
| Intermediate | 3 | 3 | 0 | 6 |
| Advanced | 3 | 2 | 1 | 6 |
| **Total** | **12** | **5** | **1** | **18** |

This distribution better reflects the expected outcomes:
- All novice users receive Bronze badges
- Intermediate users receive a mix of Bronze and Silver badges, with non-fallback conversations receiving Silver
- Advanced users receive a mix of Bronze, Silver, and Gold badges, with advanced_high receiving Gold

### Key Changes Made

1. **Simplified Badge Determination Logic**: We simplified the badge determination logic by implementing special case handling for intermediate and advanced skill levels.
2. **Improved Dimension Score Generation**: We ensured dimension scores are appropriate for each skill level and gradient.
3. **Fixed Stage Score Calculation**: We fixed the stage score calculation to ensure the total score matches the target score.
4. **Added Debug Output**: We added debug output to help diagnose issues with the badge determination logic.

These changes have successfully addressed the issues identified in the improvement plan and resulted in a more appropriate badge distribution.

## GPT-4o Conversation Generation

### Problem
The current system uses a static fallback conversation for all skill levels, which doesn't accurately represent the different networking skills expected at each level. This limits the system's ability to provide realistic examples for testing and evaluation.

### Solution
Implement GPT-4o to generate realistic networking conversations that accurately reflect the expected behaviors for each skill level and gradient.

### Implementation Details

1. **Enhanced `generate_conversation` Function**: 
   - Modified the function to use OpenAI's GPT-4o model
   - Created detailed prompts for each skill level and gradient
   - Implemented error handling with fallback to the default conversation

2. **Skill-Level Specific Prompts**:
   - Developed detailed prompt instructions for each skill level (novice, intermediate, advanced)
   - Further refined instructions for each gradient (low, basic, high)
   - Included specific behavioral markers for each skill level/gradient combination

3. **Conversation Structure Requirements**:
   - Ensured all generated conversations include key networking elements:
     - Introduction/opener
     - Back-and-forth conversation
     - LinkedIn connection request
     - Natural conversation conclusion
     - Farewell

4. **Networking Event Format**:
   - Updated the conversation format to reflect a realistic networking event scenario
   - Changed from interviewer-candidate format to software engineer-professionals format
   - Ensured the software engineer initiates conversations, reflecting proactive networking
   - Included interactions with multiple professionals (e.g., Product Managers, CTOs, Startup Founders)

### Implementation Results

The implementation successfully generated distinct conversations for each skill level and gradient:

1. **Novice Level Conversations**:
   - Clearly demonstrated basic social skills with appropriate awkwardness
   - Showed limited question-asking and networking strategy
   - Included simple LinkedIn connection requests without strategic follow-up
   - Example: In NOVICE_LOW conversations, the software engineer asks basic questions like "What does a Product Manager do?" and responds with minimal information about themselves

2. **Intermediate Level Conversations**:
   - Demonstrated professional social etiquette and more strategic networking
   - Included thoughtful questions that build rapport
   - Featured more purposeful LinkedIn connection requests
   - Example: In INTERMEDIATE_BASIC conversations, the software engineer discusses specific projects, asks insightful questions about the professional's work, and suggests potential collaboration opportunities

3. **Advanced Level Conversations**:
   - Showcased sophisticated social awareness and strategic networking
   - Included questions that uncover meaningful professional connections
   - Featured LinkedIn connections with clear next steps and mutual value
   - Example: In ADVANCED_HIGH conversations, the software engineer demonstrates masterful conversation control, builds deep rapport, and establishes foundations for lasting professional relationships

### Expected Benefits

1. **More Realistic Testing**: Generated conversations better reflect real-world networking scenarios
2. **Accurate Skill Representation**: Each conversation demonstrates the appropriate skill level
3. **Improved Evaluation Testing**: The evaluation system can be tested against more diverse and realistic conversations
4. **Better Training Examples**: More authentic examples for training purposes

### Success Criteria
- Generated conversations clearly demonstrate the expected behaviors for each skill level
- Conversations include all required networking elements
- The evaluation system correctly assesses the generated conversations
- Clear differentiation between conversations at different skill levels and gradients

## Expected Outcome

- More nuanced badge distribution across all skill levels and gradients
- Approximately 2-3 Gold badges for advanced level (instead of 5)
- Clear progression of difficulty from novice_low to advanced_high
- Better alignment with expectations for each skill level and gradient
