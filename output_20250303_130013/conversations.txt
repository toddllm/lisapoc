Badge Level: Bronze

Total Score: 8

Dimension Scores:
- Critical Thinking: 2.5
- Communication: 3.0
- Emotional Intelligence: 2.5

Stage Scores:
- Opener: 2
- Carrying Conversation: 2
- Linkedin Connection: 1

Feedback:
The conversation demonstrates basic networking skills. The candidate responds appropriately but could be more proactive in asking questions and showing interest in the interviewer. The LinkedIn connection was established, but the candidate could have been more strategic about how to leverage this new connection. The farewell was polite but generic. Overall, this represents a novice level of networking skill with room for improvement in all dimensions.
