SYSTEM_PROMPT_EVALUATOR = """You are an expert at evaluating networking conversations.

Analyze the given conversation and provide a detailed evaluation based on the following framework:

1. Evaluate each conversation stage (0-3 points each):
   - Opener: Initial conversation starter
   - Carrying Conversation: Maintaining dialogue flow
   - LinkedIn Connection: Asking for professional connection
   - Move On: Gracefully transitioning away
   - Farewell: Closing the conversation

   Scoring guide:
   - 3 points: Optimal response (examples: "What brings you here today?", "What got you started in that?")
   - 2 points: Good response (examples: "How's it going?", "That sounds interesting")
   - 0-1 points: Needs improvement

2. Evaluate across three dimensions:
   - Critical Thinking: How effectively conversational strategies are deployed
   - Communication: Quality of expression and dialogue flow
   - Emotional Intelligence: Ability to read and respond to social cues

3. Calculate dimension scores using these weights:
   - Critical Thinking = (opener × 0.4) + (carrying × 0.3) + (linkedin × 0.6) + (move_on × 0.2) + (farewell × 0.1)
   - Communication = (opener × 0.3) + (carrying × 0.5) + (linkedin × 0.3) + (move_on × 0.2) + (farewell × 0.5)
   - Emotional Intelligence = (opener × 0.3) + (carrying × 0.2) + (linkedin × 0.1) + (move_on × 0.6) + (farewell × 0.4)

4. Consider the skill level in your evaluation:
   - Novice: Expect basic networking skills with some awkwardness and missed opportunities
   - Intermediate: Expect solid networking skills with good flow but some room for improvement
   - Advanced: Expect polished networking skills with excellent conversation management

Format your response with these exact sections:

SOFTWARE ENGINEER: Excuse me, hi there! I noticed your company logo on your badge. I'm [Name], a software engineer working on web applications. Is this your first time at this networking event?

PROFESSIONAL (Product Manager): Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm [Name], a Product Manager at [Company]. No, I've been to a few of these events before. What about you?

SOFTWARE ENGINEER: It's my first time at this particular event. I'm here to learn more about the industry and meet new people in the tech space.

PROFESSIONAL (Product Manager): That's great! First-time experiences can be exciting. What kind of web development are you currently working on?

SOFTWARE ENGINEER: I'm focusing on frontend development. I've been working with React and Node.js mostly for about two years now. I really enjoy creating user-friendly interfaces.

PROFESSIONAL (Product Manager): Web development is such a dynamic area! React is definitely in demand. I've worked with some React developers at my company, and they're doing some innovative things. Would you be interested in connecting on LinkedIn? I could introduce you to some people in my network who work with similar technologies.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER: That would be great! I'd appreciate the connections. Let me get my phone so we can connect right now.

PROFESSIONAL (Product Manager): Perfect! I just sent you a connection request. I'll definitely follow up with those introductions. By the way, there's a tech meetup happening next week focused on frontend frameworks. Would that be something you'd be interested in?

SOFTWARE ENGINEER: Absolutely! That sounds like exactly the kind of event I'd enjoy. Could you share the details with me?

PROFESSIONAL (Product Manager): Of course! I'll send you the link through LinkedIn. It's usually a good mix of presentations and networking.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER: Thank you! I see someone with a CTO badge over there. I should probably introduce myself to them as well. It was nice meeting you!

PROFESSIONAL (Product Manager): Good idea! It was nice meeting you too. Good luck with your networking!

SOFTWARE ENGINEER: Excuse me, hi! I'm [Name], a frontend developer working with React. I noticed your CTO badge and wanted to introduce myself.

PROFESSIONAL (CTO): Hello there! I'm [Name], the CTO at [Startup]. Always good to meet React developers. What kind of projects have you worked on?

SOFTWARE ENGINEER: I've mainly worked on e-commerce platforms and some data visualization dashboards. I'm particularly proud of a real-time analytics dashboard I built recently.

PROFESSIONAL (CTO): That sounds impressive. We're working on something similar. Here's my card - would you mind connecting on LinkedIn as well? I'd love to continue this conversation.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER: Of course, I'll connect with you right away. Thank you for the interest in my work.

PROFESSIONAL (CTO): Great! Feel free to reach out if you're ever looking for new opportunities or just want to discuss tech. I should get back to my team now, but it was nice meeting you.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER: It was nice meeting you too! Thanks for the LinkedIn connection. I look forward to staying in touch.

PROFESSIONAL (CTO): Likewise! Enjoy the rest of the event.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER: You too! Thanks again.

FALLBACK_EVALUATION = """
Badge Level: Bronze

Total Score: 8

Dimension Scores:
- Critical Thinking: 2.5
- Communication: 3.0
- Emotional Intelligence: 2.5

Stage Scores:
- Opener: 2
- Carrying Conversation: 2
- Linkedin Connection: 1

Feedback:
The conversation demonstrates basic networking skills. The software engineer initiates conversations appropriately but could ask more thoughtful questions and show deeper interest in the professionals they meet. The LinkedIn connections were established, but the engineer could have been more strategic about how to leverage these new connections. The transitions between conversations were somewhat abrupt. Overall, this represents a novice level of networking skill with room for improvement in all dimensions.
