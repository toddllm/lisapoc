        "feedback": "The response is direct and transactional, lacking politeness and engagement. It focuses on the speaker's needs rather than mutual benefit or interest.",
        "improvement": "To improve, the speaker should rephrase the request to be more polite and engaging, such as suggesting a mutual exchange of LinkedIn profiles and expressing genuine interest in staying connected.",

        "score": 0,
        "feedback": "The response is blunt and lacks tact, demonstrating poor networking skills. It fails to consider the other person's feelings and does not facilitate a smooth transition in the conversation.",
        "improvement": "Consider using a more polite and engaging approach to exit the conversation, such as expressing a need to mingle or mentioning someone else you need to speak with.",

        "improvement": "Consider using a more engaging and personable farewell, such as 'It was nice meeting you' or 'I enjoyed our conversation.' This would help in leaving a positive impression and potentially opening the door for future interactions.",
