      Skill Scores:
      - Critical Thinking: 0.0
      - Communication: 0.0
      - Emotional Intelligence: 0.0

      Stage Scores:
      - OPENER: 0 - The response is poor and demonstrates ineffective networking skills. It lacks engagement and relevance to the networking context.
        Improvement: Start with a more engaging question or comment that relates to the event or the other person, such as asking about their reason for attending or their thoughts on the event.
      - CARRY: 0 - The response is poor and demonstrates ineffective networking skills. It lacks engagement with the other person and shifts the focus abruptly to oneself without establishing a connection.
        Improvement: To improve, the responder should ask questions about the other person's interests or experiences to build a connection. They should also find a way to relate their own interests to the conversation context.
      - LINKEDIN: 0 - The response is direct and transactional, lacking politeness and consideration for the other person's willingness to connect.
        Improvement: Try to make the request more polite and engaging. For example, 'I'd love to connect on LinkedIn to share insights and stay in touch. Would you be open to connecting?'
      - MOVEON: 0 - The response 'Gotta go.' is abrupt and lacks the politeness and tact needed in a networking context. It does not demonstrate an understanding of the other person's engagement level or provide a smooth transition to end the conversation.
        Improvement: Consider using a more polite and engaging way to exit the conversation, such as expressing a desire to connect with others or thanking the person for their time.
      - FAREWELL: 0 - The response 'Bye.' is very basic and lacks engagement. It does not demonstrate effective networking skills as it is abrupt and does not leave a positive impression.
        Improvement: Consider using a more engaging and polite farewell such as 'It was nice meeting you' or 'Great talking to you'. This would help in leaving a positive impression and potentially opening the door for future interactions.
